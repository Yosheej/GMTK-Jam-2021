# GMTK-Jam-2021
My submission for the 2021 GMTK Game Jam! It's supposed to be a mix of Portal and Parkour. It's very unfinished right now, because I only had two days to work on it. But I'm proud of the way it came out, because it's my first jam!
--------------------------------------------------
I will likely continue to work on it, and hopefully turn it into a real game! For now, here's the link for anyone who wants to try the trash tech demo.
